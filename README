mp3stream
---------

mp3stream is a very simple tool designed to be a drop-in replacement
for liveice. It reads audio data from the soundcard under Linux,
encodes it using the lame encoder (by using the great libmp3lame
library) and sends it to a shoutcast server. It can encode the data
read from the soundcard in different qualities, and send it to
different servers. This way, you can do all your livestream mixing
with only one program.

Usage
-----

mp3stream [-h] [-b bitrate] [-n name] [-g genre] [-p publicstr]
          [-d description] [-c contentid] [-u url] [-t streamurl]

-b bitrate: set the bitrate of the stream in kbps (default 128 kbps)

To send streams to multiple url, specify one or more streamurls.
The stream description will consist of the last parameters given.
For example:

mp3stream -b 128 -n "128 kbps" -t xaudio://localhost:8001/stream128
          -b 64 -n "64 kbps" -t xaudio://localhost:8001/stream64

will send a 128 kbps encoded stream to the icecast server under the
mountpoint /stream128 and a 64 kbps encoded stream to the icecast server
under the mountpoint /stream64.

mp3stream can also log the encoded data to a file by using a file:/// URL.
For example:

mp3stream -b 128 -n "128 kbps" -t xaudio://localhost/bla -t file:///var/mp3-log.mp3

will send the 128 kbps encoded data to localhost and log it into mp3-log.mp3.
